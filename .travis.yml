#Travis install phase executes mvn test, which fires the mvn sql plugin execution.
#You need a database created before the Travis install phase (see the before_install below).
#Be aware that by default, travis seems to use a username of vagrant that is not an admin on the database and cant grant permission.
#Override this by specifying the user/password when executing a command.

    - mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';"

    - mysql -u root -p -e "grant all on test.* to 'user'@'%' identified by 'password';"
